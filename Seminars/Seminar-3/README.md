# Seminar 3: Use of Arduino Simulators

This seminar focuses on learning and using Arduino simulators, allowing the development of programming and prototyping skills without the need for physical hardware.

## Objectives

- Understand the Arduino platform and its architecture.
- Explore simulating Arduino prototypes.
- Develop simple programs in various Arduino simulators.

## TinkerCad

TinkerCad Circuits is an online platform that allows you to design electronic circuits and simulate their operation.

- **Features:**
    - Creation of circuits from a library of electronic components.
    - Real-time simulation.
- **Website:** [TinkerCad Circuits](https://www.tinkercad.com/circuits)

## Requirements
1. **LED Blinking Program** - Implementation of a program that controls two LEDs (one red and one green), making them blink alternately at intervals of 1.5 seconds. The LEDs are connected to the digital outputs 12 and 13 of the Arduino.

2. **LED Control with Switch** - Modification of the LED blinking program so that the LED only lights up when a switch connected to the digital input 7 is pressed.
