# Task 3: Arduino experimentation

## Objectives
Familiarize students with the basic setup and programming of Arduino for simple input/output tasks.

## Exercises

### Minimum requirements

1. **Blinking of three LEDs**
   Control three LEDs on digital outputs with Tinkercard. The code should allow the LEDs to blink at intervals of 1.5 seconds.

2. **LED control with switch**
   Modify the previous circuit by adding a switch. Adapt the code so that the red LED lights up only when the switch is activated and the other two LEDs turn off.

### Extended requirements

1. **Distance detector**
   Use an ultrasonic sensor to detect distance and a buzzer to emit a sound based on this.
