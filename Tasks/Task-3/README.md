# Task 3: Arduino experimentation

## Objectives
Familiarize students with the basic setup and programming of Arduino for simple input/output tasks.

## Exercises

### Minimum requirements

1. **Blinking of three LEDs**
   Control three LEDs on digital outputs with Tinkercard. The code should allow the LEDs to blink at intervals of 1.5 seconds.

2. **LED control with switch**
   Modify the previous circuit by adding a switch. Adapt the code so that the red LED lights up only when the switch is activated and the other two LEDs turn off.

### Extended requirements

1. **Distance detector**
   Use an ultrasonic sensor to detect distance and a buzzer to emit a sound based on this.

Add a url to video file in your ReadMe.
Github now supports videos, see more detailed answer here: https://stackoverflow.com/a/4279746/1092815

You can see a live example here (See at the end of the readme):
https://github.com/alelievr/Mixture/blob/0.4.0/README.md

Github Pages
I strongly recommend placing the video in a project website created with GitHub Pages instead of the readme, like described in VonC's answer; it will be a lot better than any of these ideas. But if you need a quick fix just like I needed, here are some suggestions.

Use a gif
See aloisdg's answer, result is awesome, gifs are rendered on github's readme ;)

Use a video player picture
You could trick the user into thinking the video is on the readme page with a picture. It sounds like an ad trick, it's not perfect, but it works and it's funny ;).
